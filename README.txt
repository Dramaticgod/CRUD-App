# CRUD-App
Currently in developement, a basic CRUD App for event planning

The master branch contains a basic understanding of how the code works for a CRUD application. The mcv branch contains implementation of three different files
model.py, controller.py and view.py which are connected together to do the same processes.

The reasoning behind this is to understand how mcv model functions and why it is better to use the model. One of the benefits would be we can have multiple
frontends which would only change our view.py file not controller.py or model.py

The code has been commented out in the mcv branch please feel free to browse through it. This is my first attempt at MCV modelin. 


IN PROGRESS : 
Next Steps for SQL : Perform Error Checking in SQL Database (For duplicates, invalid parameters, invalid user inputs).
                     Allocate multiple tables and create a joined table.
                    
Next Steps for Frontend : Make a working example web application (using djang0, HTML, etc) or an application (using tkinter).
